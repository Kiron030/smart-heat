# Importing required libraries such as 'sensor', 'controller' or 'time'.
# test
# Import or create Datasets (including Parameter) for the basic I/O-flow. Some ideas are following:
  ## Average temperature outside in location (Germany or Berlin) as a sin function over the year --> maybe even with Fourier Transformation for daily swings
  ## Flate or room temperature 
  ## State of the valve (how open, closed is it) for the information of the speed of the heating water and the amount of heat brough into the room 

# Defining variables for the room temperature targets and the weather forecast service.

# Writing an update_temperature() function that reads the current room temperature via the sensor and adjusts the heating accordingly.

# Writing an adjust_for_weather() function that retrieves the weather forecast and adjusts the heating settings accordingly.

# Writing a function optimize_settings() that uses learning algorithms to optimize the heating settings over time.

# Writing a control_heating() function that periodically calls the update_temperature(), adjust_for_weather() and optimize_settings() functions to control the heating.

# Writing a monitor_energy_usage() function that logs and displays energy consumption and costs.
  ## Optimal would be to work with the django package or something similiar and matplotlib etc. to present a frontend user interface for the input or output of data
