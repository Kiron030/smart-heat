Possible approach for the Smart Heat script: 

- Importing required libraries such as 'sensor', 'controller' or 'time'.
- Defining variables for the room temperature targets and the weather forecast service.
- Writing an update_temperature() function that reads the current room temperature via the sensor and adjusts the heating accordingly.
- Writing an adjust_for_weather() function that retrieves the weather forecast and adjusts the heating settings accordingly.
- Writing a function optimize_settings() that uses learning algorithms to optimize the heating settings over time.
- Writing a control_heating() function that periodically calls the update_temperature(), adjust_for_weather() and optimize_settings() functions to control the heating.
- Writing a monitor_energy_usage() function that logs and displays energy consumption and costs.
